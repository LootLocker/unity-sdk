## Installation

The following steps outline how to install the LootLocker SDK into your Unity project.

1. Download the latest Unity Package Release from the [Github](https://github.com/LootLocker/unity-sdk) repository or from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/180099)**.**
2. Double-click on the package or drag the package into your Unity scene to import it.
3. LootLocker requires “Editor Coroutine” from the package manager to function properly. If you currently have this in your project you can click exit in the window that displays after importing.
   Note: If you imported from github release and not Unity. You might need to open the package manager and install "Editor Coroutine". Otherwise project might not compile.
4. If you are importing the package into an already existing project, please untick the project settings so your settings are not overwritten.
5. If you already have the package “JsonDotNet” or “NewtonJson” from the Unity Asset Store or Github, please untick the “Dependencies” folder
6. Click import to complete the SDK installation

**Note**: If you do not intend to use the Admin SDK, Unity Samples or Sample App, you can safely delete the folders within the LootLocker folder to reduce the size of the project.

## Set Up

Now that you have installed the SDK into your Unity project, you will want to connect the Unity project to your game in the LootLocker Management Console.

The following steps walks you through configuring the LootLocker Unity SDK to work with a game that has been created in the LootLocker Management Console at [my.lootlocker.io](https://my.lootlocker.io)

There are two methods for setting up the SDK: using the Admin SDK or by manually editing the config file.

### Using the Admin SDK

The Admin SDK is provided as a simple tool to login to your LootLocker account and configure your Unity project to a game you have set up in the LootLocker Management Console.

1. Navigate to the menu bar and select Window/Open LootLocker Admin Panel.
2. Enter the email and password for your LootLocker account. If you do not have a LootLocker account you can create one by visiting [lootlocker.io/sign-up](https://www.lootlocker.io/sign-up).
3. In the LootLocker Admin Panel, select the game you wish to use.
4. In the Project view, navigate to LootLocker/Game/Resources/Config.
5. Click on LootLockerConfig.
6. Modify your the following:
   1. Game Version e.g 1.0.0.0
   2. Platform e.g Android, Steam
   3. Environment e.g Development
You are now ready to use LootLocker and connect to your game's APIs.

### Modifying the Config

Alternatively, you can configure your Unity project manually by excluding the Admin SDK from the installation.
